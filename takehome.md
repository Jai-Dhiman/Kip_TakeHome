Kip Engineering Take-Home Assignment
The Problem
Executives say a lot of things on earnings calls. Some of it is accurate. Some of it is misleading. We want to know the difference. Build a system that analyzes earnings call transcripts, extracts quantitative claims made by management, and verifies them against actual financial data.

Example: If a CEO says "revenue grew 15% year over year," your system should check if that's true.
Requirements
Pick 10 public companies of your choice
For each company, get the transcripts for last 4 quarters
Extract quantitative claims from the transcript
Verify each claim against structured financial data
Flag discrepancies or misleading framing,
[bonus] include quarter-to-quarter discrepancy
Be deployed somewhere we can interact with it
Deliverables
Source code (GitHub repo)
Loom video walking through a working demo
Short README covering: your data sources, key decisions, and what you'd improve with more time
[bonus] if we can access your demo.
Evaluation
We’re not looking for a hackathon demo. We’re looking for something you’d be genuinely proud to show others—whether that’s the data pipeline, the verification logic, the UI, or how you handled edge cases. Pick your battles.

We’ll evaluate correctness, how you handled data acquisition, and your decision-making process. Be prepared to walk through your implementation and explain what “misleading” means to your system..
